"""
Write a function, is_prime, that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given number is prime.

A prime number is a number that is only divisible two distinct numbers: 1 and itself.

For example, 7 is a prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 7. On the other hand, 6 is not a prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

You can assume that the input number is a positive integer.
