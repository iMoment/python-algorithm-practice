# python-algorithm-practice

A compilation of problems in Python to practice algorithms.

### How to use
Each problem is separated into its own folder that includes three files:  
- <ins>**problem_title.py:**</ins> contains the problem prompt and where you will implement your solution
- <ins>**solution.py:**</ins> contains a working solution to the problem if you get stuck or give up, along with Big-O analysis
- <ins>**test.py:**</ins> contains test cases for use against your solution. Execute this file directly from your working directory after you have completed your implementation in **problem_title.py** to test for correctness.
