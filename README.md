# python-algorithm-practice

A compilation of problems in Python to practice algorithms.

### How to use
Each problem is separated into its own folder that includes three files:  
- <ins>**problem_title.py:**</ins> contains a prompt string describing the problem to be solved. Comments are also given to indicate the ***required*** function name to be implemented, along with information on provided input types and expected output types. Helper functions can be created to assist in solving problems, however, test cases contained in **test.py** will only call the ***required*** function name when evaluating your code. Refer to test cases for expected output types if there is any confusion.  

- <ins>**solution.py:**</ins> contains a working solution to the problem if you get stuck or give up, along with Big-O analysis.  

- <ins>**test.py:**</ins> contains test cases for use against your solution. Execute this file directly from the working directory after you have completed your implementation in **problem_title.py** to test for correctness.  

### Problem Types and Categories
- **000~004:** Introductory Practice
- **005~008:** Hashing  

Although designed to be completed in a linear order, feel free to skip to particular problem types for targeted practice.
