# python-algorithm-practice

A compilation of problems to practice algorithms.
Each problem is separated into its own folder that includes three files:
- **problem_title.py:** Contains the problem prompt and where you will implement your solution
- **solution.py:** Contains a working solution to the problem
- **test.py:** Contains test cases for use against your solution; execute this file after you have completed your implementation in problem_title.py
