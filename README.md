# python-algorithm-practice

A compilation of problems in Python to practice algorithms.

### How to use
Each problem is separated into its own folder that includes three files:  
- <ins>**problem_title.py:**</ins> contains a prompt string describing the problem to be solved. Comments are given to indicate the ***required*** function name to be implemented, along with information on provided input types and expected output types. The first test case is also shown to further clarify expected outputs. Helper functions can be created to assist in solving problems, however, **test.py** will only call the ***required*** function name when evaluating your code. Refer to test cases inside **test.py** for expected output types if there is any confusion.  

- <ins>**solution.py:**</ins> contains a working solution to the problem if you get stuck or give up, along with Big-O analysis.  

- <ins>**test.py:**</ins> contains test cases for use against your solution. Execute this file directly from the working directory after you have completed your implementation in **problem_title.py** to test for correctness.  

All the problems in this repository fall into a particular concept or technique to be practiced. Although designed to be completed in order, feel free to skip to specific problem types for targeted practice. It is highly encouraged that the associated technique is utilized to solve their respective problems. While alternative solutions may exist, these exercises have been grouped together to practice fundamental concepts commonly found in technical interviews.
