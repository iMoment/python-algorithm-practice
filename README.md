# python-algorithm-practice

A compilation of problems in Python to practice algorithms.\
Each problem is separated into its own folder that includes three files:\
- <ins>**problem_title.py:**</ins> Contains the problem prompt and where you will implement your solution
- <ins>**solution.py:**</ins> Contains a working solution to the problem
- <ins>**test.py:**</ins> Contains test cases for use against your solution; execute this file after you have completed your implementation in problem_title.py
